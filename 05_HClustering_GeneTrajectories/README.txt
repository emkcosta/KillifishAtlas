Hierarchical Clustering
=============================================================================================

01_hclust_treebased.R - hierarchical clustering of sex-combined gene trajectories for genes expressed in all tissues; specifically outputs clustering for a subset of tissues (Liver, Kidney, Muscle, Brain, and Gut)

02_HyperGO_hclust_clusters_250101.R - perform GO enrichment for the clusters for each of the tissues for which gene expression trajectories were clustered above

03_HyperGO_BubblePlot_hclust_clusters_BrainOnly_250102.R - make bubble plot of GO enrichment for brain, associated with Figure 3, ExtData Fig 5A, ExtData Fig 5C

04_HyperGO_BubblePlot_hclust_clusters_GutOnly_250102.R - make bubble plot of GO enrichment for gut, associated with ExtData Fig 5B

05_HyperGO_BubblePlot_hclust_clusters_MuscleOnly_250102.R - make bubble plot of GO enrichment for muscle, associated with ExtData Fig 5D
